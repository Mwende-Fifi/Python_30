"""### Mini Project
Project: Number Guessing Game
Project Description:
The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100. 
The player will have a limited number of chances (letâ€™s say 7) to guess the number. 
After each guess, the program will tell the player whether their guess is too high or too low. 
If the player guesses correctly within the allowed number of attempts, they win. 
Otherwise, the game ends and the player loses."""
